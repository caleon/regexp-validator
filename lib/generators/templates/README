Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

	1. 	Setup models with either:
		
		 		rex_validate :name, :email, :age

			or add an option to existing `validates [FIELD]` calls like:
		
				validates :name, :regexp => true

  2. 	Setup routes with :constraints => { :id => regex_for(:id) } for instance
			but they will automatically be handled if you run `rex_validate` within
			your model.

				
	3.	You can also call form tag helpers with the option :regexp => true
			to implant a client-side level of validation based on HTML5 and
			Javascript.
